			When you use our website, sign-up to view our content or participate in events, you consent to the collection,
			storage, use, disclosure, and other uses of your data as described in this Privacy Policy.

		<div class="terms-title">What type of data do we collect?</div>

		<p>
			When you access our website, we collect your IP address and information regarding your general location. We also
			use various technological tracking tools such as cookies which are used to store content information and
			preferences relating to your interactions with our website.
		</p>

		<p>
			We also collect analytics data about the use of our website. This may include data related to website visits, page
			views, site interactions, browser type, display settings, operating system, device type, session start/stop time,
			referral URL, time zone, and network connection type. We may merge data collected through these tracking
			technologies and data we may obtain from other sources and, as a result, such data may become personal data.
		</p>

		<p>
			We may receive your personal information when you communicate with us. For example, when you send us an email or
			contact us through the forms on our website, we will collect the information you provide to us. We may also
			collect your information when you sign-up or register to view content prepared by us (e.g. white papers, webinars)
			or participate in events hosted or sponsored by Amadeo. This information may include your email address, your
			telephone number, information about your company and your position, your country, and any other information
			submitted by you.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our websites may include social media features. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are
			visiting on our website, and may set a cookie so that the social media feature works properly. Social media
			features are governed by the privacy policies of the website providing the feature.
		</p>

		<p>
			We may receive personal data from our business partners. We may combine information collected about you with
			information from third-party sources.
		</p>

		<div class="terms-title">
			How do we use the data we collect?
		</div>

		<p>
			We will use your data to operate our website, to communicate with you, to keep you informed of the latest updates
			to our website, products, and services, and provide you, or have our business partners provide you, with offers.
		</p>

		<p>
			We may use your personal data for our internal marketing and promotional purposes. For example, by subscribing to
			our newsletter you will receive announcements from us. You may choose not to receive our promotional or marketing
			emails (all or any part thereof) by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in the emails that you receive from us.
			Please note that even if you unsubscribe from our communications, we may continue to send you
			product/service-related updates and notifications, or reply to your queries and feedback you provide us.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you do not want us to use your personal data for marketing purposes, you may opt-out by sending an email
			request to unsubscribe@amadeo.tech. Please note that even if you opt-out, we may still use your data for
			non-marketing purposes (for example to fulfill your requests, communicate with you, and respond to your inquiries,
			etc.).
		</p>

		<p>
			From time to time, we may conduct surveys or test features, and analyze the data we have to develop, evaluate and
			improve these features and our internal business operations, in order to better understand our customers and
			improve our business operations, website, products, and services.
		</p>

		<p>
			We may use your personal data when we believe it’s necessary in order to take precautions against liabilities,
			investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, investigate and protect ourselves
			from fraud, protect the security or integrity of our services and protect the rights and property of Amadeo, its
			users and/or partners. We may use your personal data in order to enforce our policies, including but not limited
			to our website Terms of Use. We may also use your personal data to investigate violations, and as required by law,
			regulation, or other governmental authority, or to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process.

		<p>
			We share your information with companies in our group, as well as employees and contractors, and our business
			partners, in order to operate the website, to communicate with you, and to offer and provide our products and
			services to you.
		</p>

		<p>
			We share your information with our third-party service providers, such as web-hosting providers, storage, customer
			management, analytics, survey, and email service providers. These third parties may have access to your personal
			data so that they may provide these services on our behalf but they are not permitted by us to use your personal
			data for any other purpose.
		</p>

		<p>
			We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.
			We will disclose any data about you to the government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in
			our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not
			limited to subpoenas), to protect our or a third party’s property and rights, to protect the safety of the public
			or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being illegal,
			unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable. We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal data
			in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including meeting national security or law enforcement
			requirements.
		</p>

		<p>
			We may share your data if we enter into a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition, reorganization,
			bankruptcy, or sale of some or all of our assets. Any party that acquires our assets as part of such a transaction
			may continue to use your data in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

		<div class="terms-title">
			Transfer of data outside the EEA
		</div>

			Please note that some data recipients may be located outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). In such cases, we
			will transfer your data only to such countries as approved by the European Commission as providing an adequate

			accordance with applicable law. By providing us with your personal data, you hereby consent to such transfers of
			data outside the EEA.

		<div class="terms-title">How we protect your information</div>

		<p>
			We have implemented administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, use, or
			disclosure of your data. We limit access to your information to those employees, subcontractors, and service
			providers who require access to the data to discharge their duties to us.
		</p>

		<p>
			While we seek to protect your information to ensure that it is kept confidential, we cannot absolutely guarantee
			its security. You should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the
			internet. While we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of
			your personal data or other content you transmit while using the website, and you do so at your own risk.

			Retention
		</div>

		<p>
			We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to provide our website, products, and services, and as
			necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our policies. Retention periods will
			be determined taking into account the type of information that is collected and the purpose for which it is
			collected, bearing in mind the requirements applicable to the situation and the need to destroy outdated, unused
			information at the earliest reasonable time. Under applicable regulations, we will keep records containing client
			personal data, communications, and anything else as required by applicable laws and regulations.
